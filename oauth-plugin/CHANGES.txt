Version 0.10

Potential improvements:
- Unit test coverage.

Release notes 0.10 (TBA)
- Fix for GRAILSPLUGINS-2438, OauthService#getRequest(Map) does not set access token on OAuthConsumer.
- Fix for GRAILSPLUGINS-2437, OauthService should not re-use provider/consumer objects.
- Make getRequest() append params to the URL's query string. Services such as the Twitter API expect
    the params as URL parameters and will ignore headers. Unfortunately, for now we still add
    headers otherwise signpost doesn't seem to sign them correctly.
- Do not add params to "both" the query string and headers.
